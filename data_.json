of player-created mods on Terraria with tModLoader - this DLC makes modding Terraria a reality!<br><br>tModLoader (TML) is an open-source, community-driven modification and expansion of the Terraria game that makes it possible to make and play mods. TML expands your Terraria adventures with new content to explore created by the Terraria community! TML allows players to create and play Terraria mods and is designed in such a way so that you can play alone or together with friends - with one mod or with multiple, choose to play however you like!  <br><br>NOTE: It is required that all your friends also install TML if you want to play together; it is not possible for vanilla users to play with TML users.<br><br>---<br><br><strong><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SUPPORT</h2></u></strong><br>Looking for some help? You can receive support on our forum thread on Terraria Community Forums or our Discord server! These are our best places to get support, and they are both linked directly from our Website, which you will find below on our Steam Store Page.<br><br>tModLoader is an open-source project. This means the code is publicly available and anyone can make contributions to the project. Our project can be found on Github, linked via our Website.<br><br>Do you want to learn more about the inner workings for tModLoader? Maybe you want to use tModLoader right now? You can get started with our guide for players linked below on our Steam Page under &quot;View the Manual&quot;. There are also pages for developers and contributors. Our wiki is filled with guides that learn you how to mod using tModLoader.<br><br>---<br><br><strong><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FAQ</h2></u></strong><br>Here are some important things to know when you Install and get ready to dive into tModLoader:<br><br><strong><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You do not have to make any backups<br></li><li>Simply update Terraria to 1.4 and install tModLoader on Steam<br></li><li>You can play vanilla Terraria and TML alongside each other; tModLoader through Steam is treated as a separate game.<br></li><li>tModLoader supports Terraria 1.3 and 1.4<br></li><li>Steam Workshop is supported (but not required, we have an in-game mod browser)<br></li><li>With the new release, tModLoader can be installed anywhere regardless of location or whether it is a Steam install.<br></li><li>tModLoader will work for Windows, Mac and Linux</li></ul></strong><br><br><strong>How will this affect me? Will my mods still work when Terraria 1.4 is released?</strong><br>Because this update brought many changes to tModLoader, a lot of mods if not all will be broken. Even though we've given modders time to update their mods, it is likely some mods will never be updated to this version.

Both games are being developed in concert, many of SG's more ambitious features will make an appearance in Exanima as development continues.<br><br>Exanima provides a reasonably complete and meaningful game experience, but many more features are on their way!

Real momentum, forces and collisions are always at play here, every nuance of your inputs is crucial to the outcome. This will likely be unlike anything you've played before and may take some practice, but can be hugely rewarding and the skill cap is virtually infinite. It is not particularly fast paced or difficult but it does require you to pay attention, it is very tactical and just casually pressing buttons won't get you very far!</strong><br><br>Our goal is to create a deep and immersive RPG world based on a more advanced simulation supporting an unprecedented level of dynamic and emergent gameplay. All of the technology we use including the game engine is our own, developed from the ground up to realise this vision.<br><br>Exanima is born as a prelude to Sui Generis (SG), our ambitious open world RPG that has been in development for over two years following a successful Kickstarter campaign. Exanima is a smaller yet complete game in its own right, a dungeon crawler that takes place in SG's Underworld some twenty years prior to its events. Both games are being developed in concert, many of SG's more ambitious features will make an appearance in Exanima as development continues.<br><br>Exanima provides a reasonably complete and meaningful game experience, but many more features are on their way! We have met our most challenging and significant development goals, now we are ready to bring new features to light and make an even more fun and compelling adventure. Here are some of the planned features, with many already being close to completion:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Per session and global character skill progression<br></li><li>Large non-linear main game following early content<br></li><li>Build and permanently save characters by completing early content<br></li><li>New encounters, items and environments<br></li><li>Ranged combat and new close quarter manoeuvres<br></li><li>Numerous moddable thaumaturgic powers <br></li><li>More complete arena game modes featuring outdoor arenas<br></li><li>Complex NPC interactions and dialogue<br></li><li>Cooperative and competitive LAN multiplayer</li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/362490/extras/InsHrOg01.png?t=1651083974\" />", "short_description": "Explore, fight, survive and unravel mysteries in this unique and unforgiving 3D isometric RPG set in an original dark, low fantasy world.

These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.<br><br><strong>Travel across the planet.</strong> You're not stuck in one place.

There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.<br><br><strong>People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment.</strong> They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.<br><br><strong>Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities.</strong> Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects.
